# Introduction  <br>

Security is a paramount concern in both residential and commercial settings. The 4-bit password security 
system presented in this report aims to provide a user-friendly and cost-effective solution for securing 
access to various applications, including doors, bank lockers, digital appliances, and switching systems. 
The system relies on a 4-bit password entry, requiring the user to input a specific combination for 
authorized access.  <br>


# Project Description  <br>

The 4-bit password security system utilizes NOR and XOR gates in its design. The system consists of two 
sets of switches - "KEY CODE SWITCHES" representing the correct password and "DATA ENTRY 
SWITCHES" for entering the code. If the entered data matches the key code, the system allows access by 
lighting up a green LED. Conversely, if the data does not match, a red LED indicates an unauthorized 
attempt.  <br>


# Project Requirements  <br>

The following components are required for the project: <br>
4001 quad NOR gate <br>
4070 quad XOR gate <br>
Two four-position DIP switches <br>
Two light-emitting diodes (LED) <br> 
Four 4007 "switching" diodes <br>
Ten 10k ohms resistors <br> 
Two 470 ohms resistors <br>
Pushbutton switch (normally open) <br>
9-volt battery <br> 



# Hardware Components Specifications <br>

4001 Quad NOR Gate: <br>
Used to perform logical NOR operations in the circuit. <br>
4070 Quad XOR Gate: <br>
Performs exclusive OR operations, crucial for password validation. <br>

### Four-Position DIP Switches: <br>
Represent the "KEY CODE SWITCHES" and "DATA ENTRY SWITCHES." <br>

### Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs): <br>
Two LEDs indicate access status - green for authorized access and red 
for unauthorized attempts. <br> 

### 4007 "Switching" Diodes: <br>
Essential for signal routing and preventing feedback. <br>

### Resistors: <br>
Ten 10k ohms resistors and two 470 ohms resistors for proper current limiting.  <br>

### Pushbutton Switch (Normally Open): <br>
Used for system reset or other control functions. <br>

### 9-Volt Battery: <br>
Power source for the circuit.  <br>


# Working Principle: <br>

The XOR gates compare the entered data with the key code, and the NOR gates generate output signals 
based on the comparison results. The green LED indicates a correct password match, while the red LED 
signals an incorrect attempt. <br>

# Applications: <br>

### Locking of Doors: <br>
Provides a secure and cost-effective door locking system.
Bank Lockers: Enhances security for individual bank lockers. <br>

### Digital Appliances: <br>
Used for password-protected access to devices like mobile phones, computers, 
laptops, and tablets. <br>

### Switching Systems: <br>
Applied for secure switching of appliances such as air conditioners, LEDs, and TVs. <br>


# Conclusion:  <br>

The 4-bit password security system offers a practical and effective solution for enhancing security in 
various applications. It's simple design and reliable operation make it suitable for both residential and 
commercial settings
